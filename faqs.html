            <li><h2>What types of flooring do you offer?</h2></li> 
            <br>At Full Service Flooring, we offer a wide variety of flooring options, including hardwood, laminate, vinyl, carpet, tile, and luxury vinyl plank (LVP). Each type comes in various colors, patterns, and textures to suit your style and budget.

            <li><h2>How long does it take to install new flooring?</h2></li> 
            <br>The installation time depends on the type of flooring and the size of the area. Typically, smaller projects can be completed in a day or two, while larger spaces may take up to a week. We’ll provide an estimated timeline during your initial consultation.

            <li><h2>Do you offer free estimates?</h2></li> 
            <br>Yes, we do! We offer free, no-obligation estimates for all our services. During the estimate, we’ll assess your space, recommend the best flooring options, and provide a detailed quote.

            <li><h2>Can you remove my old flooring?</h2></li> 
            <br>Absolutely! We offer flooring removal services as part of our installation package. Our team will safely remove and dispose of your old flooring to prepare your space for the new installation.

            <li><h2>How do I maintain my new flooring?</h2></li> 
            <br>Maintenance varies depending on the flooring material. For hardwood, regular sweeping and occasional refinishing will keep it looking great. For carpets, we recommend vacuuming and professional cleaning. We’ll provide specific care instructions based on the type of flooring you choose.

            <li><h2>Can I install flooring myself, or do I need a professional?</h2></li> 
            <br>While some DIY enthusiasts may be able to handle basic flooring projects, professional installation ensures the job is done right, saving you time and potential issues in the long run. Our team is experienced and equipped to handle even the most complex installations with precision and care.
